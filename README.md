## Setup 

Download the code to your PC.

Make sure that all python modules are available at your PC and up to date.

Get a Google Maps API key from Google.

`GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"`

## Run

Best to run in PyCharm. 

Make sure to run the `google_panorama.py` first. 

Make sure to download the test images and add them inside the `panoramas/_Test` folder before running the `algorithms.py` file.
